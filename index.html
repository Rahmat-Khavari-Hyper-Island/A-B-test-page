        <h1>Welcome to A/B test page!</h1>
        <br>
        <p>This is a simple page designed to demonstrate the concept of A/B testing. The page consists of two sections: a static
        section and a dynamic section. The static section remains consistent across both versions, A and B. However, the dynamic
        section varies depending on the chance (fifty-fifty) of loading the page for each user. Additionally, a button has been
        included for the Call to Action (CTA), and GDPR information is displayed in the console.</p>
